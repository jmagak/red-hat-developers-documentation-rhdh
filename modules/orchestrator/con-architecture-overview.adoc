= Understand Orchestrator architecture

The Orchestrator architecture is composed of several components, each contributing to the running and management of workflows.

{product} ({product-very-short}):: Serves as the primary interface. It contains the following subcomponents:

Orchestrator frontend plugins::: Provide the interface for users to run and monitor workflows within {product-very-short}.

Orchestrator backend plugins::: Get workflow data into {product-short}.

Notifications plugins::: Inform users about workflow events.

Sonataflow::

The Sonataflow orchestrator and its subcomponents handle the workflows.
The {product} Orchestrator and the {product} Helm chart manage the following subcomponents lifecycle:

OpenShift Serverless Logic Operator::: Manages the Sonataflow custom resource (CR), where each CR represents a deployed workflow.

Sonataflow Runtime/Workflow Application::: Functions as a deployed workflow. Operates as an HTTP server, handling requests for running workflow instances. It is managed as a Kubernetes (K8s) deployment by the Openshift Serverless Logic Operator.

Data Index Service::: Serves as a repository for workflow definitions, instances, and associated jobs. It exposes a GraphQL API used by the Orchestrator backend plugin to retrieve workflow definitions and instances.
Job Service::: Orchestrates scheduled tasks for workflows.

OpenShift Serverless::: Provides serverless capabilities essential for workflow communication. It employs Knative eventing to interface with the Data Index service and uses Knative functions to introduce more complex logic to workflows.

PostgreSQL Server::: Provides a database solution essential for data persistence within the Orchestrator ecosystem. The system uses PostgreSQL Server for storing both Sonataflow information and {product-short} data.

Keycloak:: Provides authentication and security services within applications. Keycloak must be provisioned externally to manage authentication, as the Orchestrator Operator does not install it.

OpenShift AMQ Streams (Strimzi/Kafka):: Provides enhanced reliability of the eventing system. Eventing can work without Kafka by using direct HTTP calls, however, this approach is not reliable.

Optional: The current deployment iteration does not natively integrate or include the AMQ Streams Operator. However, you can add the Operator post-install for enhanced reliability if you require it.
