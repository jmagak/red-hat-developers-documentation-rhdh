= Enabling Orchestrator plugins components

To use the Orchestrator, enable the Orchestrator plugins for {product}, that are disabled by default:

Orchestrator frontend plugins::

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator`:::
Provides the interface for users to run and monitor workflows within {product-very-short}. You can run and track the execution status of processes.

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form-widgets`:::
Provides custom widgets for the workflow execution form, allowing you to customize input fields and streamline the process of launching workflows.

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form`:::
Provides the workflow execution form where you can define and submit the necessary input data required to start a new workflow instance.

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-form-api`:::
Defines the API for extending the workflow execution form.

Orchestrator backend plugins::

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-backend`:::
Gets workflow data into {product-short} making sure {product-very-short} ingests critical workflow metadata and runtime status fulfilling your need for visibility.

`backstage-plugin-orchestrator-common`:::
Contains the backend OpenAPI specification along with autogenerated API documentation and client libraries.

`scaffolder-backend-module-orchestrator`:::
Provides callable actions from scaffolder templates, such as `orchestrator:workflow:run` or `orchestrator:workflow:get_params`.

Notification plugins::

`backstage-plugin-notifications`:::
Provides notification frontend components that allow you to display immediate, visible alerts about key workflow state changes, allowing real-time status tracking.


`backstage-plugin-signals`:::
Provides notification frontend components user experience enhancements so you can process the real-time lifecycle events.

`backstage-plugin-notifications-backend-dynamic`:::
Provides notification backend components allowing you to manage and store the stream of workflow events, making sure that critical notifications are ready to be served to the front-end user interface.

`backstage-plugin-signals-backend-dynamic`:::
Provides the backend components for notification user experience enhancements allowing you to establish the necessary communication channels for the event-driven orchestration that is core to Serverless Workflows.

.Prerequisites

* When using the {product} Helm chart, you have installed the necessary OpenShift Serverless Operators.
+
[NOTE]
====
When using the {product} Operator, the Operator installs the necessary OpenShift Serverless Operators automatically. For specific use cases, install the dependencies manually or use helper utilities.
====

* (Optional) For managing the Orchestrator project, you have an instance of Argo CD or Red Hat OpenShift GitOps in the cluster. It is disabled by default.

* (Optional) To use Tekton tasks and the build pipeline, you have an instance of Tekton or Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines in the cluster. These features are disabled by default.

.Procedure
* Locate your {product-short} configuration and enable the Orchestrator plugins and the supporting notification plugins.
