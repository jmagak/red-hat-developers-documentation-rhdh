= Install the Orchestrator flavor using the OpenShift web console

You can install the Orchestrator flavor of {product} ({product-very-short}) using the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) web console. This method is useful if you prefer a graphical interface or want to deploy cluster-wide resources without using the Helm CLI.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must be a cluster administrator to install the Orchestrator Helm chart because it deploys cluster-scoped resources.
====

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console as a cluster administrator.
* You have access to the {product} Helm chart repository.
* Your cluster has internet access or the Helm charts are mirrored in a disconnected environment.

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift web console, go to menu:Helm[Helm Charts].

. Click btn:[Repository] and confirm that the {product} Helm chart repository is available. If not, add it manually.

. Search for the Orchestrator Helm chart and click btn:[Install].

. In the install form:
  * Choose or create a target namespace.
  * Accept or modify the default values as needed.
  * Review and confirm the cluster-scoped resources that the chart will install.

. Click btn:[Install] to deploy the chart.

. Monitor the deployment status by navigating to menu:Workloads[Pods] or menu:Helm[Releases].

.Verification

After deployment completes:

* The orchestrator-related pods should be running in the selected namespace.
* Cluster-wide resources such as CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) should be present.
* You can begin connecting the orchestrator to your {product} UI.
