= Displaying company logo in the global header

You can configure a company logo in the *Global Header* of the {product} ({product-very-short}) to reflect your company's branding.

The `CompanyLogo` supports strict display constraints to ensure visual consistency:

* Maximum dimensions: 150px wide, 40px high.
* The logo must retain its original proportions.
* The component layout remains fixed and cannot be moved from its mount point.
* Supports the following props:
** `logo`: Encoded logo image.
** `to`: The redirect path where the logo is clicked.

.Procedure

To display a custom company logo in the *Global Header*, update the configuration with a mount point for `CompanyLogo`:

  mountPoints:
    - mountPoint: application/header
      importName: GlobalHeader
      config:
        position: above-sidebar

By default, `position` is set to `above-main-content`.
