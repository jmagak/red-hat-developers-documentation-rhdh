= Configuring logo size in the Global Header

You can control the display size of your company logo in the *Global Header* by configuring the *width* and *height* properties. You can align the logo's size with your company's branding and ensure consistent presentation within {product} ({product-very-short}).

This configuration applies only to the *Global Header* using the `CompanyLogo` component.

.Prerequisites

You have permissions to modify the {product} configuration.

.Procedure

.Configuring logo size
Use the red-hat-developer-hub.backstage-plugin-global-header configuration block to set the logo width and height:

[source,yaml]
----
- mountPoint: global.header/component
importName: CompanyLogo
config:
  priority: 200
  props:
    to: '/'
    logo:
      light: <image>
      dark: <image>
    width: 300
    height: 100
----

You can adjust *width* and *height* to control the pixel size of the logo in the *Global Header*. If you omit these values, the `CompanyLogo` component uses its default sizing.

Use this configuration with theme-specific logos to maintain consistent branding across `light` and `dark` themes.

.Verification

. Apply the configuration in your cluster or local environment.
. Navigate to the *Global Header* in the {product-short} UI.
. Confirm that:

.. The logo displays using the specified *width* and *height*.
.. The correct logo appears based on the active theme (`light` or `dark`).
