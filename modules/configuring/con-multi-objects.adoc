= Multi objects

You can define and create multiple objects of the same type in a single YAML file when the object type is marked with `Multi=true`.

For example, adding the following code snip to `pvcs.yaml` creates two PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) called `backstage-<cr-name>-myclaim1` and `backstage-<cr-name>-myclaim2` and mounts them to {product-custom-resource-type}  container accordingly.
