[id="con-default-base-urls"]
= Default base URLs

The Operator sets the base URLs fields in the default `app-config` ConfigMap known as `backstage-appconfig-{CR_name}` created per Custom Resource, based on the Route parameters and the OpenShift cluster ingress domain.

The following are the rules governing the mentioned behavior:

* No change if the cluster is not OpenShift.
* No change if `spec.application.route.enabled` is explicitly set to false in the CR.
* The base URLs are set to `https://<spec.application.route.host>` if `spec.application.route.host` is set in the {product-custom-resource-type}  CR.
* The base URLs are set to `https://<spec.application.route.subdomain>.<cluster_ingress_domain>` if `spec.application.route.subdomain` is set in the {product-custom-resource-type}  CR.
* The base URLs are set to `https://backstage-<CR_name>-<namespace>.<cluster_ingress_domain>`, which is the domain set by default for the Route object created by the Operator.

The following `app-config` fields might be updated in the default `app-config` ConfigMap:

* `app.baseUrl`
* `backend.baseUrl`
* `backend.cors.origin`

[NOTE]
====
You can perform these actions on a best-effort basis and only on OpenShift. During an error or on non-OpenShift clusters, you still have the ability to override such defaults by providing custom `app-config` ConfigMap.
