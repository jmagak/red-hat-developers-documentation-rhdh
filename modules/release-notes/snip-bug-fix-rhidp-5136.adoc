= Resolved the `stdout maxBuffer` error

Previously, the `export-dynamic-plugin` failed with an error that the `stdout maxBuffer` length was exceeded.

With this update, the CLI redirects the output of the {{yarn install}} command it performs during the export process to a file. Therefore, a successful completion of the {{yarn install}} command and verification of the `export-dynamic-plugin`, cleans up the file. The file is available for troubleshooting when the dynamic plugin validation checks fail.
