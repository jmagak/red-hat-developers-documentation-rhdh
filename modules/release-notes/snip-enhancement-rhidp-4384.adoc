= Enhanced use of `kube-rbac-proxy`

This update removes the `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar container from the {product-very-short} Operator Pod. This sidecar container protected the operator metrics endpoint. However, the main container now provides this functionality out-of-the-box. Removing this sidecar container allows for reducing the resources required to run the Operator.
