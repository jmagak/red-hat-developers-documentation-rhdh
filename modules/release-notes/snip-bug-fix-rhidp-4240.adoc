= Removed the pre-configured custom resources from the k8s configuration

Before this update, the custom resources in k8s configuration were pre-configured. As a result, users could see tekton warnings without configuring the custom resources in k8s.

With this update, the pre-configured custom resources from the k8s configuration are removed. Therefore, users can custom resources to the Kubernetes configuration based on their requirements, preventing unrelated warnings from appearing.
