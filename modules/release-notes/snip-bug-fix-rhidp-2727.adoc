= Github issues plugin now supports multiple Github integration hosts

Before this update, Github issues plugin used the first Github integration it found for all components. This prevented the plugin from being properly used when multiple Github integration hosts were present.

With this update, Github issues plugin now supports multiple Github integration hosts. It uses the well-known entity slug annotation `backstage.io/source-location` or `backstage.io/managed-by-location` to determine the appropriate Github integration for a  component. If no integration matches the slug, the first GitHub integration will be selected, maintaining the previous behavior.
