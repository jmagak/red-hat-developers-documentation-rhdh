= GitHub issues plugin supports multiple GitHub integration hosts

Previously, the GitHub issues plugin defaulted to using the first GitHub integration it detected for all components. This behavior made it incompatible with setups involving multiple GitHub integration hosts.

Now, GitHub issues plugin supports multiple GitHub integration hosts. It uses the well-known entity slug annotation `backstage.io/source-location` or `backstage.io/managed-by-location` to determine the appropriate GitHub integration for a component. If no integration matches the slug, the first GitHub integration is selected, maintaining the previous behavior.
