= `export-dynamic-plugin` fails to find dependencies nested deeper than one level in `node_modules`

Previously, the CLI examined the dependencies of embedded packages during the export process to know if other packages should be embedded. One of the methods was calling {{require}} when the CLI encountered a built embedded package, which was the case when wrapping an existing plugin. 

This update changes the parent directory that the {{require}} uses from the monorepo root to the embedded package. Therefore, the dependent package found is the dependency that is most relevant to the embedded package.
