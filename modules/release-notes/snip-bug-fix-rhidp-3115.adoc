= {product-very-short} helm chart deployment throws `NotAllowedError`

Previously, when deploying with the Helm Chart, there could be a mismatch between the Route hostname and the `baseUrl` fields added to the generated app-config ConfigMap. This could sometimes cause failure to authenticate against some providers due to an origin mismatch.

This update fixes this issue by ensuring no mismatch between those values.
