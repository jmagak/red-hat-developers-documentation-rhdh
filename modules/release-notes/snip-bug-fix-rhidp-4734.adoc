= Resolved RBAC API inconsistency when scaling deployments to more than one pod

Before this update, scaling the deployment to more than one pod caused RBAC roles to remain unsynced, allowing only the pod that created the resource to serve it.

With this update, RBAC roles are now properly synced across all pods, with Redis cache and traffic routing configured to ensure consistency across the deployment.
