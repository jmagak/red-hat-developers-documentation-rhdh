= Removed RBAC API inconsistency when scaling deployment to above 1 pod

Before this update, when scaling the deployment to above 1 pod, RBAC roles were not synced. Only the pod that creates the resource would be able to serve it afterwards.

With this update, RBAC roles are now properly synced across all pods, with Redis cache and traffic routing configured to ensure consistency across the deployment.
