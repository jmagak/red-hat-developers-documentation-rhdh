= `--suppress-native-package` and `--allow-native-package` flags to handle native modules

Previously, the CLI failed with a message that native modules are not supported.

This update introduces two new CLI flags that help dynamic plugin developers handle native modules. Both flags accept a list of packages. The `--suppress-native-package` flag does not require the native module at runtime. It replaces the native module with an empty package that displays an error. The `--allow-native-package` flag instructs the CLI to allow the native package during checks, and tests a plugin that uses a native module.
