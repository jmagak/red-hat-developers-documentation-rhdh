= Fixed the techdoc text selection during reporting a techdoc issue

Before this update, the feature to report a documentation (techdoc) issue failed. Therefore, when a user selected a text in a techdoc, a large icon appeared instead of a tooltip-button.

With this update, users can select texts when reporting a documentation (techdoc) issue.
