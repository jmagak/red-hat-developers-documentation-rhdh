= Resolved the issue with text selection when reporting a TechDoc issue

Previously, the feature to report a documentation (TechDoc) issue failed. Therefore, when a user selected a text in a TechDoc, a large icon appeared instead of a tooltip button.

With this update, users can select texts when reporting a documentation (TechDoc) issue.
