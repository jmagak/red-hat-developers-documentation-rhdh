== Multi-Attached error for Volume (PVC)

Currently, when deploying {product-short} using the Helm Chart, two replicas cannot run on different cluster nodes. This might also affect the upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4.0 if the new pod is scheduled on a different node.

Possible workarounds for the upgrade include the following actions:
* Manually scale down the number of replicas to 0 before upgrading your Helm release. 
* Manually remove the old {product-short} pod after upgrading the Helm release. However, this would imply some application downtime.
* Leverage a Pod Affinity rule to force the cluster scheduler to run your {product-short} pods on the same node.

== [Helm] Cannot run two RHDH replicas on different nodes due to Multi-Attach errors on the dynamic plugins root PVC

If you are deploying {product-short} using the Helm Chart, it is currently impossible to have 2 replicas running on different cluster nodes. This might also affect the upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4.0 if the new pod is scheduled on a different node.

A possible workaround for the upgrade is to manually scale down the number of replicas to 0 before upgrading your Helm release. Or manually remove the old {product-short} pod after upgrading the Helm release. However, this would imply some application downtime.
You can also leverage a Pod Affinity rule to force the cluster scheduler to run your {product-short} pods on the same node.

[id="known-issue-rhidp-4695"]
== [Doc] OIDC refresh token behavior 

When using {rhsso-brand-name} or {rhbk-brand-name} as an OIDC provider, the default access token lifespan is set to 5 minutes, which corresponds to the token refresh grace period set in {product-short}. This 5-minute grace period is the threshold used to trigger a new refresh token call. Since the token is always near expiration, frequent refresh token requests will cause performance issues.

This issue will be resolved in the 1.5 release. To prevent the performance issues, increase the lifespan in the {rhsso-brand-name} or {rhbk-brand-name} server by setting *Configure &gt; Realm Settings &gt; Access Token Lifespan* to a value greater than five minutes (preferably 10 or 15 minutes).

== Topology plugin permission is not displayed in the RBAC front-end UI

Permissions associated only with front-end plugins do not appear in the UI because they require a backend plugin to expose the permission framework's well-known endpoint. As a workaround, you can apply these permissions by using a CSV file or directly calling the REST API of the RBAC backend plugin. Affected plugins include Topology (`topology.view.read`), Tekton (`tekton.view.read`), ArgoCD (`argocd.view.read`), and Quay (`quay.view.read`).
