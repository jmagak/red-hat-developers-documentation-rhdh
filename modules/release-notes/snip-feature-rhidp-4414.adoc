= Dynamic plugin configuration using `flavor`

This update adds a new configuration value `flavor` to identify on which flavor of Backstage a plugin is running. Plugin authors can use this configuration value to tailor their plugins based on whether the plugins are running on {product-very-short}, RHTAP, or Backstage.
