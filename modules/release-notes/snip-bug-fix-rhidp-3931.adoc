= Added alert on the deletion icon during bulk imports

Before this update, repositories were added to {product-short} from various sources, such as `app-config` files or GitHub discovery. The Bulk Import plugin only tracked repositories accessible using the configured GitHub integrations. When both plugins were enabled, repositories discovered by GitHub Discovery appeared on Bulk Import pages. However, deleting these repositories from Bulk Import Jobs had no effect, as entities from discovery or `app-config.yaml` file remained in the {product-short} catalog.

With this update, an alert on the deletion icon notifies the user to modify the source (either the `catalog-info` within the repository or the `app-config.yaml` file if the file originates from there) to remove the catalog entity.
